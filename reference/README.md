**S288C**

*S288CReference:* Files for each chromosome and the mitochondrial genome were downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database and concatenated without any renaming to produce this file.

*S288CReferenceAnnotated.fasta:* The header of each FASTA file was manually edited to contain as its first word "Scer_XX" where XX gives the chromosome number in Arabic numerals, or the name of the sequence. The FASTA sequence for the 2-micron plasmid was obtained through a personal communication. The renamed files for each chromosome, the 2-micron plasmid, and the mitochondrial genome were concatenated to produce this file.
