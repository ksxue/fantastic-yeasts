Alignment
========================

This directory contains basic analyses of sequencing data from Bootleg Biology strains. It is focused primarily on determining what proportion of reads map to different species of yeasts.

**ANALYSIS**

Using Run.sh, I analyze the bowtie2 logs for each sequenced sample from an attempted alignment to S288C. I extract the total percentage of reads that align to that genome for each sequenced sample.
