data
========================

This directory contains metadata and small data files for this project.

**BB**

These strains were obtained through Jeff Mello at Bootleg Biology, clonally isolated, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq by Jenny Madeoy.

*metadata-BB-raw.tsv* These files contain the raw strain annotation provided by Jeff Mello, the YMD ID numbers provided by Maitreya Dunham, and the Illumina barcoding information provided by Jenny Madeoy.

*metadata-BB-formatted.txt* This file has been formatted to be read easily by R.

*Samples-BB.data* This file contains the paths to raw reads, trimmed reads, and the sample name for each sequenced strain in the BB collection.

*Samples-BB.test* This file contains the paths to raw reads, trimmed reads, and the sample name for a single test strain in the BB collection.

**DunhamBeer**

These 16 brewing strains were obtained from a local yeast supplier by Maitreya Dunham and sequenced by Giang Ong.

*metadata-DunhamBeer-raw.tsv* This file contains the raw annotation data for the sequenced strains, including their Wyeast numbers and the brews with which they are associated.

**Verstrepen**

These 157 industrial yeast strains from White labs were sequenced and described in Gallone et al., *Cell*, 2016. (doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.020)

*metadata-Verstrepen-raw.xlsx* This file corresponds to Table S1 of Gallone et al., *Cell*, 2016. It lists each strain, its place of origin, sequencing statistics, and SRA information.

*metadata-Verstrepen-raw.txt* This file is a parsable version of the Excel table *metadata-Verstrepen-raw.xlsx*.

*metadata-Verstrepen-accessions.txt* This file contains the SRA accessions for all runs associated with SRP109074, the SRA experiment associated with this study.

**McCusker**

These 100-genomes strains (consisting of 93 novel strains) were sequenced and described in Strope et al., *Genome Research*, 2015. (doi: 10.1101/gr.185538.114)

*metadata-McCusker-accessions.xlsx* This file corresponds to Table S19 of Strope et al., *Genome Research*, 2015. It contains the Genbank accessions for the *de novo* assemblies of chromosome for each strain. It also contains SRA accessions for each strain.

*metadata-McCusker-accessions.txt* This file is a parsable version of the Excel table *metadata-McCusker-accessions.xlsx*.

*metadata-McCusker-raw.docx* This file corresponds to Table S1 of Strope et al., *Genome Research*, 2015. It contains geographical annotations for each of the 93 sequenced strains.
